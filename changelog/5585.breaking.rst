As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 5.X series and are now
removed:

* The ``funcargnames`` read-only property of ``FixtureRequest``, ``Metafunc``, and ``Function`` classes. Use ``fixturenames`` attribute.

* ``@pytest.fixture`` no longer supports positional arguments, pass all arguments by keyword instead.

* Direct construction of ``Node`` subclasses now raise an error, use ``from_parent`` instead.

* The default value for ``junit_family`` has changed to ``xunit2``. If you require the old format, add ``junit_family=xunit1`` to your configuration file.

* The ``TerminalReporter`` no longer has a ``writer`` attribute. Plugin authors may use the public functions of the ``TerminalReporter`` instead of accessing the ``TerminalWriter`` object directly.

* The ``--result-log`` option has been removed. Users are recommended to use the `pytest-reportlog <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-reportlog>`__ plugin instead.
