When collecting tests, pytest finds test classes and functions by examining the
attributes of python objects (modules, classes and instances). To speed up this
process, pytest now ignores builtin attributes (like ``__class__``,
``__delattr__`` and ``__new__``) without consulting the ``python_classes`` and
``python_functions`` configuration options and without passing them to plugins
using the ``pytest_pycollect_makeitem`` hook.
